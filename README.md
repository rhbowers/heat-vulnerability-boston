# Boston Heat Vulnerability Analysis
ZCTA-level extreme heat vulnerability assessment in the Boston MPO region. Final project submission for UEP279 (Geospatial Programming with Python).

### Project Summary

This Python analysis uses geospatial and tabular data for six different indicators related to population, environmental, and healthcare characteristics to identify Boston-area Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) that are vulnerable to extreme heat. As climate change and urbanization increase the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, it will be critical to implement policy and planning interventions that identify and proect at-risk populations from the health impacts of prolonged heat exposure. 

### Running the Project Notebook
- Create and activate `heat-vulnerability` environment using `environment.yml` file. User must have Miniconda or Anaconda installed as a primary dependency.
- Launch `jupyterlab`and open notebook `heat-vulnerability-assessment.ipynb` to walk through project notebook.

##### Pre-Processing

Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level-2 tiles number 012030 and 012031 from May 21, 2020 were downloaded from the USGS EarthExplorer. Both tiles were determined to have less than two percent cloud cover with the Boston Metropolitan Area appearing cloud-free. The tiles were mosaicked together using gdal_merge.py and then further processed using gdalwarp. The rasters were reprojected to EPSG:6491 and clipped to the extent of the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization boundaries while retaining the original 30-metre resolution.
